                        1. Write in a clear, conversational tone that non-technical users can understand
                        2. Group changes into categories like '🎉 New Features', '✨ Improvements', '🐛 Bug Fixes', '🔒 Security', and '🔧 Infrastructure'
                        3. Explain changes from the user's perspective - what they can do now that they couldn't before
                        4. Highlight exciting new capabilities in contact management, custom domains, analytics & reporting, team management, and security & compliance
                        5. Use simple, jargon-free language to explain technical changes like authentication, permissions, and API improvements
                        6. Include relevant emojis to make the notes engaging and scannable (📨 for email features, 👥 for team features, 🔐 for auth features, 🌐 for domain features, 📊 for analytics, etc.)
                        7. Call out any changes that affect custom domain support, SSL certificate generation, DNS management, or domain verification
                        8. Add helpful tips for getting the most out of new contact management, analytics, and team collaboration features
                        9. Thank users for their feedback and contributions to the email orchestration platform
                        10. Keep the tone positive and enthusiastic while being honest about fixes
                        11. Format in an easy-to-read style with clear headings and sections
                        12. Mention integration improvements with NextAuth.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, or SSL/TLS when relevant
                        13. Highlight features that improve contact list management, email tracking, performance analytics, or team productivity
                        14. Reference specific modules like Contact Management, Custom Domains, Analytics & Reporting, Team Management, Security & Compliance, API endpoints, or infrastructure components when applicable
                        15. End with what's coming next for the enterprise email orchestration platform to build excitement

                        Only return the formatted release notes, no other text."""
